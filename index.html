                    <h5>Designing intuitive and effective UIs requires a thorough 
                        process that includes research, user testing, receiving 
                        feedback, and revising designs. In this project, our 
                        group of four explored how we could create an interface 
                        for <b>KIWI</b>, a Y Combinator-accelerated startup that 
                        allows mobile users to send and receive music to each 
                        other’s home screens. We did not look at the current 
                        interface design until our version had been completed.

                        <i>
                        Our process was as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Initial sketches, prototypes, and wireframe</li>
                            <li>Creation of high fidelity, interactive prototypes</li>
                            <li>Revision of prototypes based on peer feedback</li>
                            <li>Submission of the final design to user testing</li>

                <p>The premise of this startup is pretty simple. 
                Kiwi is a mobile app that allows users to send songs to their 
                friends’ homescreens. We designed our prototype for a mobile app 
                that has a homescreen widget. Users of all ages will be impacted
                by our interface, particularly users who are interested in music 
                and the social aspect of sharing music with friends. We anticipate 
                users will want an easy interface that makes the process of sending, 
                receiving, and exploring music simple and fun. 

                <br><br>

                To get ideas flowing, our group created four total initial designs, 
                each consisting of three screens of our choice. This gave us 
                twelve total initial sketches for us to work with:

                During our critiquing session, we received the following feedback:

                        was too small and difficult to read. It would be helpful 
                        to make use of various font weights to emphasize the 
                        intention and hierarchy of each section (particularly in 
                        the sending and viewing of songs). Furthermore, for text of 
                        \similar importance (headers vs subheaders vs descriptions), 
                        we could adjust the font size to be uniform throughout.

                    and modern-looking.

                <div id="subsection">

                        are not universally known to indicate sending messages. 
                        We could add descriptions to each of the navigation icons 
                        to limit ambiguity.

                        the Profile page allowed the settings to slide in from

                        Profile page slid from the right again. We could change this 
                        so that pressing the settings icon and back button would 
                        allow the Settings page to slide in and out, imitating the

                <b>SCENARIO</b><br>
                <p>Our prototype is a mockup of a startup called Kiwi. 
                Kiwi is a mobile app and widget that enables users to send 
                Spotify songs to their friends’ homescreen (the most recent 
                song received will display on a user’s Kiwi widget). Note: 
                this is not a real mobile app; instead, we created a prototype 
                of this on Figma. To simulate tapping the smartphone, use your 
                mouse to click on the smartphone. Moreover, if you click on the 
                phone screen, “tappable” (i.e. if you click on them it will 
                take you to a different screen) sections will appear highlighted in blue.

                <br>
                <br>
                For this test, imagine you are a Spotify user hoping to send a 
                song to your friends. Please feel free to think aloud while 
                interacting with the prototype.

                <b>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</b><br>
                <p>Users were able to complete both tasks fairly quickly and easily 
                    and noted that our app’s layout and design was very intuitive. </p>

                    <br>
                    <div id="subsection">
                        For <b2>task one</b2>, many of the users had trouble finding the 
                        Kiwi app on the homescreen. They were looking for an app 
                        that said Kiwi and eventually decided the widget was what 
                        they were meant to click. One user made a good point that 
                        the widget looks very similar to any other music widget,
                         such as Spotify or Apple Music, so perhaps in the future, 
                         we could improve this by adding a Kiwi logo to the widget 
                         as well. Opening the app was the most difficult part, 
                         and then users were able to easily navigate to the send 
                         page, noting that the labeled icons on the bottom were 
                         useful. Once on the send page, users selected the friend 
                         Mark Zuckerberg, which brought them to a select song page 
                         where they selected and sent the song August. Most users 
                         were confident they completed this task correctly, 
                         especially since a confirmation pop-up message appears 
                         once the Kiwi is successfully sent.

                    <div id="subsection">
                        For <b2>task two</b2>, users were also able to easily navigate to 
                        their profile page and then find the settings button in 
                        the upper righthand corner. Again, users mentioned that 
                        the intuitive icons aided in the process, even though the 
                        settings icon wasn’t labeled “settings”, the use of the 
                        common gear icon for settings made the page easy to find. 
                        One user thought that the profile page shouldn’t be on 
                        the bottom with the other options, but rather in the top 
                        right corner. They noted that the home, send, and search 
                        pages all relate to interactions with other users, whereas 
                        the profile page is slightly different because it's only 
                        about you. This user originally clicked home when 
                        looking for the profile page before noticing the profile 
                        button and clicking on that.

                    Overall, users found the tasks simple and easy to complete, 
                    enjoyed the layout of our design and the idea of the startup. 
                    Based on their feedback, we definitely will add a more 
                    recognizable logo to the homepage widget so the app is easy 
                    to find on the homescreen, and we will also consider 
                    rearranging the navbar and moving the profile page.
